Simulating VoIP Applications over the Real Network
==================================================

Goals
-----

TODO: what is the goal of THIS showcase really?
TODO: sounds bad
Voice over IP (VoIP) was developed in order to provide access to voice
communication in any place around the world. Media streams are
transported using special media delivery protocols that encode audio.

TODO: is this needed?
INET framework features
various modules for emulating different models and scenarios, including
VoIP traffic.

This showcase demonstrates how one can run simulated VoIP applications
over a real network using INET components.

| INET version: ``4.0``

About VoIP
----------

Voice over Internet Protocol (also voice over IP, VoIP or IP telephony)
is a methodology and group of technologies for the delivery of voice
communications and multimedia sessions over Internet Protocol (IP)
networks, such as the Internet.

VoIP uses codecs to encapsulate audio into data packets, transmit the
packets across an IP network and decapsulate the packets back into
audio at the other end of the connection. By eliminating the use of
circuit-switched networks for voice, VoIP reduces network infrastructure
costs, enables providers to deliver voice services over their broadband
and private networks and allows enterprises to operate a single voice
and data network.

The model
---------

TODO:

.. The ``ExtLowerUdp`` module makes it possible to divide the simulated model into
   two parts at the transport layer, exchange one part with real

.. The ``ExtLowerUdp`` module makes it possible for the model to be extracted
   from the simulation and be used in a real operating environment. The
   model executes the configured behavior in the real world while still
   producing the same statistics as used to.

The network
~~~~~~~~~~~

Usually a network in a simulation contains some nodes and connections in
between. In this case, it is different. Only a simulated sender
application and a simulated receiver application are needed in order to
send the packets into the real network on one side and receive them on
the other side.

There are only two modules per "network". There is a
``VoipStreamSender`` in the sender application and a
``VoipStreamReceiver`` in the receiver application, both called ``app``.
Both Applications contain a ``ExtLowerUdp`` module, called ``udp``. The
layout of the two applications can be seen in the following image:

+----------------------------------------------+--+---------------------------------------------+
|        Voip Stream Sender Application        |  |      Voip Stream Receiver Application       |
+==============================================+==+=============================================+
|.. image:: media/VoipStreamSenderApplication.png    |  |.. image:: media/VoipStreamReceiverApplication.png |
|   :width: 100%                               |  |   :width: 100%                              |
|   :align: center                             |  |   :align: center                            |
+----------------------------------------------+--+---------------------------------------------+

These two simulations work completely separated from each other, meaning
that they could also be run on different devices. However, for the sake
of simplicity, during this showcase both are run on the same computer.
As the names of the applications indicate, the
``VoipStreamSenderApplication`` produces a VoIP traffic and sends the
packets to the ``VoipStreamReceiverApplication`` as destination, while
the ``VoipStreamReceiverApplication`` receives and processes the VoIP
packets.

The simulation is run until all the packets arrive.

Configuration and behaviour
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``VoipStreamSender`` and ``VoipStreamReceiver`` modules are part of the
simulation. There is no difference in the configuration of these modules
compared to a fully simulated scenario. This means that the ``ExtLowerUdp``
module looks and behaves just like the ``UdpApp`` from the point of view
of the modules above them.

**VoipStreamSender:**

As stated above, in this showcase, both simulations are run on the same
computer. That is why the ``destAddress`` parameter is set to
``27.0.0.1`` address, called the loopback address, referring to *this
computer*.

.. literalinclude:: ../sender.ini
   :language: ini
   :start-at: packetTimeLength

The ``VoIP`` configuration is run in order to demonstrate that the sound
is actually transmitted from the sender to the receiver.

**VoipStreamReceiver:**

.. literalinclude:: ../receiver.ini
   :language: ini
   :start-at: localPort

Although the ``udp`` module is the key module of the emulation, it does
not need any configuration. This module acts as a bridge between the
simulated and the real world. When instead of ``UdpApp`` this ``ExtLowerUdp``
is used, it means that from that point on the emulation is running in
the real world. In this case it means that at the ``ExtLowerUdp`` the VoIP
traffic exits the simulation and enters the real operating environment
of the OS, and vice versa.

Another important point of the emulation is to set the
``RealTimeScheduler`` as the mean of synchronization:

.. literalinclude:: ../receiver.ini
   :language: ini
   :start-at: RealTimeScheduler
   :end-before: tkenv-plugin-path

Using this scheduler, the execution of the simulation is synchronized to
the real time of the CPU.

.. note::

   Operation of the real-time scheduler: a "base time" is
   determined when ``startRun()`` is called. Later on, the scheduler object
   calls ``usleep()`` from ``getNextEvent()`` to synchronize the simulation
   time to real time, that is, to wait until the current time minus base
   time becomes equal to the simulation time. Should the simulation lag
   behind real time, this scheduler will try to catch up by omitting sleep
   calls altogether.

Results
-------

Original music
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As a reference, you can listen to the original audio file by clicking
the play button below:


.. raw:: html

   <p><audio controls> <source src="media/original.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">Your browser does not support the audio tag.</audio></p>

This music is then sampled and forwarded by the ``VoipStreamSender``
module and received by the ``VoipStreamReceiver`` module. The packets
exit the simulation at the ``ExtLowerUdp`` of the sender side and enter the
other simulation at the ``ExtLowerUdp`` of the receiver side. In between the
packets travel across the real network (the computer's loopback
interface in our case).

**VoIP** configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Due to the high sampling rate, the quality of the received sound is
nearly as good as of the original file:

.. raw:: html

   <p><audio controls> <source src="media/sound.wav" type="audio/wav">Your browser does not support the audio tag.</audio></p>

It is stated above that the two simulations run separately on the same
device using the computer's loopback interface. To provide some evidence
for supporting this statement, we can take a look at the network traffic
rate of the interfaces of the computer. The following video shows how
the traffic rate of the loopback interface (named ``lo``) changes while
the simulation is running:

.. video:: media/loopback.mp4
   :width: 100%
|

It is clearly visible that the traffic rate of the loopback interface
increases from the former value of zero to a higher, relatively constant
value, as soon as the sender side of the emulation is started. After the
end of the simulation, meaning that there are no more data to be sent,
the traffic rate falls back to zero.

Conclusion
----------

It is not necessary to rewrite the simulated model into a suitable form
for testing it in the real world. Using external interfaces, parts of a
simulation can easily be extracted into the real operating environment.
This feature of INET makes developing, simulating and testing much
simpler.
